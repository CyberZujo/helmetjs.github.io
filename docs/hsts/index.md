In short: this module sets the `Strict-Transport-Security` header to keep your users on HTTPS.

The attack
----------

HTTPS, while not always perfect, is a secure protocol. HTTP, by contrast, is horrible. "Vanilla" HTTP users are vulnerable to person-in-the-middle attacks and nothing sent is encrypted. I like to think of insecure HTTP as "anything goes".

If I want to hack you, I would much prefer you to be on HTTP over HTTPS.

The header
----------

The `Strict-Transport-Security` HTTP header tells browsers to stick with HTTPS and never visit the insecure HTTP version. Once a browser sees this header, it will only visit the site over HTTPS for the next 60 days:

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=5184000
```

Note that the header won't tell users on HTTP to *switch* to HTTPS, it will just tell HTTPS users to stick around. You can enforce HTTPS with the [express-enforces-ssl](https://github.com/aredo/express-enforces-ssl) module.

The code
--------

Helmet's HSTS is a relatively simple middleware that will set the `Strict-Transport-Security` header.

You can use this module as part of Helmet:

```javascript
// Make sure you run "npm install helmet" to get the Helmet package.
var helmet = require('helmet')

// Sets "Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=5184000; includeSubDomains".
var sixtyDaysInSeconds = 5184000
app.use(helmet.hsts({
  maxAge: sixtyDaysInSeconds
}))
```

You can also use it as a standalone module:

```javascript
// Make sure you run "npm install hsts" to get the hsts package.
var hsts = require('hsts')

// Sets "Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=5184000; includeSubDomains".
var sixtyDaysInSeconds = 5184000
app.use(hsts({
  maxAge: sixtyDaysInSeconds
}))
```

### Including subdomains

The `includeSubDomains` directive is included by default. To opt out, set the `includeSubDomains` option to `false`.

```javascript
// Sets "Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=5184000".
app.use(helmet.hsts({
  maxAge: sixtyDaysInSeconds,
  includeSubDomains: false
}))
```

### Setting the header conditionally

By default, this header is set if `req.secure` is `true`. `req.secure` is a boolean auto-populated by Express. If you're not using Express, that value won't necessarily be set, so you have two options.

First, you can choose to set the header conditionally with the `setIf` option. This is a function that will be passed the request and response objects. It should return `true` if the header should be set and `false` otherwise.

```javascript
app.use(helmet.hsts({
  // ...
  setIf: function (req, res) {
    if (req.secure) {
      return true
    } else {
      return false
    }
  }
}))
```

Second, you can force the header to *always* be set:

```javascript
app.use(helmet.hsts({
  // ...
  force: true
}))
```

### Preloading HSTS in Chrome

Google lets you submit your site for baked-into-Chrome HSTS by adding `preload` to the header. You can add that with the following code, and then submit your site to the Chrome team at [hstspreload.appspot.com](https://hstspreload.appspot.com/).

```javascript
app.use(hsts({
  // Must be at least 18 weeks to be approved by Google
  maxAge: 10886400,

  // Must be enabled to be approved by Google
  includeSubDomains: true,
  preload: true
}))
```
