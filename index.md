Helmet helps you secure your Express apps by setting various HTTP headers. *It's not a silver bullet*, but it can help!

Quick start
===========

First, run `npm install helmet --save` for your app. Then, in an Express app:

```javascript
var express = require('express')
var helmet = require('helmet')

var app = express()

app.use(helmet())

// ...
```

That's it! Helmet will set various HTTP headers to help protect your app.

How it works
============

Helmet is a collection of 12 smaller middleware functions that set HTTP headers. Running `app.use(helmet())` will not include all of these middleware functions by default.

You can see more in [the documentation](/docs).
